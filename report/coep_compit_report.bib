 abstract = {The disparate data and commands from are received from a managed resource (102) and have potentially different semantics. The disparate data and commands are processed according to rules received from an autonomic manager (112) to produce a single normalized view of this information. The actual state of the managed resource is determined from the normalized view of disparate data. The actual state of the managed resource (102) is compared to a desired state of the managed resource (102). When a match does not exist between the actual state and the desired state, a configuration adjustment to the managed resource (102) and/or another resource is determined to allow the actual state to be the same as the desired state. Then, the configuration adjustment is applied to the managed resource (102). When a match exists between the actual state and the desired state, maintenance functions associated with the managed resource (102) are performed.}

 abstract = {The self-healing system comprises a self-healing processor and an error mitigation system. The self-healing processor includes a code block associated with the operation of a portion of digital logic. The self-healing processor also includes a dynamic signature analysis circuit. The processor executes the code block. The dynamic signature analysis circuit creates a dynamic signature representing the operation of the portion of digital logic associated with the code block. The error mitigation system receives the dynamic signature from the dynamic signature analysis circuit. The error mitigation system compares the dynamic signature to a static signature to determine if the signatures match. If the signatures do not match, then the digital logic associated with the code block has an error. The error mitigation system retries execution of the code block. The error mitigation system stores log information describing the above events.}

 abstract = {A mechanism is provided for achieving autonomic computing self-healing utilizing meta level reflection. In a base level, a monitor detects an error in a production environment. The base level provides a reification message comprising data about the error to a meta level. A reasoning system in the meta level receives the reification message and analyzes the data using knowledge of computational components in the base level. The reasoning system identifies a self-healing action for the error and returns a reversion message comprising a signal to implement the self-healing action. Responsive to receiving the signal, the base level implements the self-healing action.}
